[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/async-promises.png?compact=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/async-promises/)

Async control flow patterns using promises based on https://github.com/caolan/async

It needs an ES6 environment to work (Promises, Block-scoped binding constructs, etc) like modern browsers and node 4.

Example:

```javascript
var asyncP = require('async-promises');

var args = [];
return asyncP
  .each([1, 3, 2], (x) => {
    return new Promise(function (resolve) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        args.push(x);
        resolve();
      }, x * 25);
    });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log(args); //prints [1, 2, 3]
  });
```
